# Respeaker-And-Matrix-Voice-RaspberryPi-Cases

You can use this 3d Model as is for private use only, commercial or mass production is not allowed

To be able to use Respeaker 4 Mic array in the bigger case you need an pgio extender so the respeaker sits a bit higher. I used the extender which is delivered with the matrix voice to get the respeaker fit into the case.
